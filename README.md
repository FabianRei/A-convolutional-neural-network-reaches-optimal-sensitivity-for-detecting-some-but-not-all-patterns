# Optimal networks

Source code for the paper "A convolutional neural network reaches optimal sensitivity for detecting some but not all patterns".  Reith and Wandell. (arXiv)


The paper trains CNNs to detect different types of signals in noise.  The signal generation code is in Matlab and depends on ISETCam (https://github.com/iset/isetcam/wiki).  The network training code is in Python and imports various libraries.

An example script that is an overview of the whole process is:

The script that generated the data points in Figure 2 is:

The script that generated the data points in Figure 3 is:
